## Locating Food: Filtering Options
As a user, when I query a certain dish, I'd like to be able to specify how I'd like the results to be displayed. 

### By Location
I want to be able to filter dishes based on which is closest to me. In this case, I do not care how great the dish itself is, all I care about is getting my hands on that food. The results in this case will be filtered from closest to furthest available locations depending on where I am when I do the search.

### By Highest Ratings
I want to eat the very best dish that I've searched for. I do not care if it is far away nor do I care if it's expensive. I want my results to show me the highest rated dish and descending into the lowest ranked dish.

### By Price
I am a user on a budget. I want to eat the dish I have searched for, but I would also like to be mindful of the cost. The results from my search will show in descending order most affordable option to most expensive.

## Lists
As a user, I want to be able to organize dishes into categorized lists. When I navigate to the lists page I will see the lists I've already made, the default "Favorites" list (see **Favorites**) and the option to create a new list. Upon clicking one of my lists, I'll be taken to a page with all of the dishes I added to the list. I can sort these dishes by date added, and the three filtering options listed under **Locating Food: Filtering Options**. 

### Add Dish to List

As a user, I want a default location to save my favorite dishes without having to make a new list for them. "Favorites" is a pre-made list that I have by default as a user.

#### Favorite a Dish
I want a simple way to add dishes to my Favorites. To add a dish to my Favorites, I press the the heart-shaped Favorite icon next to a dish shown in my search query results. I can navigate to Favorites from my Lists or my User Profile page
